(* Description *)
rmlbuild is a plugin for ocamlbuild that allows to build ReactiveML
programs more easily.

(* Usage *)
- Copy 'myocamlbuild.ml' and 'myocamlbuild_config.ml' to the directory
  where your files are.

- For a program:
    * Create a foo.rmlsim file with the following contents:
******************************** START HERE
file: bar.rml
sim: main
sampling: 0.1
n : 100
******************************** END HERE

This will tell the ReactiveML compiler that the main process of your program
is the 'main' process in the file "bar.rml". 'n' and 'sampling' can be
omitted and have the same meaning as in the command line.

    * To use an external libray, modify the myocamlbuild.ml file to add:
      Myocamlbuild_config.rml_lib ~dir:mylib_dir "mylib";
      and then add 'use_mylib' to the tag of the .ml and .byte files,
      just as for 'ocaml_lib'.

    * Run 'ocamlbuild foo.byte' to build the program

- For a library:
    * Create a mylib.rmllib file, containing the names of modules to
      add to the library (as for an ocaml library).

    * Run 'ocamlbuild mylib.cma'
